# Airline Review Analysis

This project analyzes airline reviews to understand customer satisfaction and identify key factors influencing travel experiences. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, sentiment analysis, and hypothesis testing.

## Project Overview

The project aims to:
- Determine what factors are influencing consumer decisions.
- Analyse how holiday booking times affect consumer behavior.
- Investigate the level of popularity of different airline schedules and routes.
  
It aims to answer the following research questions:
1. What is the relationship between traveller type and customer satisfaction?
2. How does the travel season affect customer satisfaction?
3. Is there a difference in customer satisfaction between different travel classes?
4. Which routes have the highest and lowest customer satisfaction?

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is "Airline_Review.csv," which contains airline reviews. It includes passenger name, flying month, route, rating, review content, traveller type, and class.

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. Data cleaning:
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates
   - Cleaning and formatting data columns

2. Exploratory data analysis:
   - Analyzing the distribution of ratings
   - Identifying popular routes
   - Exploring traveller type and class distributions

3. Sentiment analysis:
   - Classifying reviews as negative, positive, or neutral using sentiment intensity analysis

4. Hypothesis testing:
   - Using statistical tests to analyze the relationship between variables and answer research questions

## Results

- Customer satisfaction varies depending on the traveller type, travel season, and travel class.
- Specific routes have notable differences in customer satisfaction levels.
- The sentiment analysis provides insights into the overall customer perception of the airline.
